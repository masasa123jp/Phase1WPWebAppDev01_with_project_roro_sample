 * recommendations might be generated for logged‑in users.  In a real
 * implementation you would query the `category_data_link` and
 * `roro_recommendation_log` tables to determine which items have been
 * served to the current user and which eligible items remain.  The
 * selected items could then be rendered with appropriate markup.
 *
 * For the purposes of this example the recommender simply returns a
 * placeholder message.  It demonstrates how you could structure your
 * code for extensibility while keeping the front‑end presentation
 * separate from the core logic.
